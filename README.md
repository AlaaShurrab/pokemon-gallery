## **The solution** :bulb: :-

- create a simple website with pure HTML/JS 

## **User Stories**  :books: 

- As a USER, I want a display to all the pokemons in one place .
- As a USER, I want to be able to search for any pokemon by name .
- As a USER, I want to be able search for pokemons by thier number on wiki.
- As a USER, I want to view five random pokemons every time i open the site.

## **How to Launch App Locally** :-

*  clone this repo

*  Run `yarn` to install the packages for the app as general.

### Database Setup  :clipboard:

make sure you have installed PostgreSQL and pgcli 

```sql=
CREATE DATABASE {database name};
CREATE USER {user name} WITH superuser password {password}
ALTER DATABASE {database name} OWNER TO {user name};
```
- Test DB:
- Do the same as before but make sure to change the names.

* Run the following command  
`yarn build:db`

### **Environment variables:**
Environment variables are one of the ways we keep our product safe. If you want to access our app locally you will need to add your own.
- create .env file
- add your Environment variables
```sh
DATABASE_URL= # Your production PostgreSQL connect
PORT= #port number
```

### Start the App :electric_plug:

To start the App Locally you can start the server First then start client-side or vice versa!
> To run Server, In your terminal Type: 

    `yarn dev` then you should be able to go to [localhost](http://localhost:(your port here)/) 


Now you can view the app live in the Browser!
